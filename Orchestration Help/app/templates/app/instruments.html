<p style = "margin-top:0.4cm">
    There're usually four kinds of instruments in a standard symphony orchestra: woodwind, brass, percussion, and string.
</p>
<p style = "margin-top:0.1cm">
    Woodwind instruments are most often used to convey emotional subjects, or offer a continuous chord background, due to their rather soft timbre.
    <br>
    Brass instruments, on the other hand, are used to demonstrate military or epic statements, as well as enhancing the stability of tutti of the whole orchestra.
    <br>
    The usage of percussion instrument differs greatly from one to another, but the most common effect is changing the sound quality of the orchestra, i.e. making it massive/passionate/mysterious.
    <br>
    String instruments have the most plasticity among all instruments in the orchestra, making them almost possible to present every kind of emotion or trick you want them to.

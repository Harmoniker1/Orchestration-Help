# Orchestration Help

## Introduction

This is a website built using python-django framework, and based on the default template "Twitter Bootstrap" offered by Visual Studio. The overall idea of this website is to provide information on orchestration, but more interaction like forums and issue requests may be added.

## How to run

This website hasn't been published yet. If you have Visual Studio 2019 installed, simply clone this repository, open the solution file, choose Orchestration_Help/manage.py as startup item and run. If you haven't, then follow the corresponding basic rules of running a django website on your system.

Will not choose programming as career, but will always do some from now and then, maybe merge the skills of physics and programming to create something *amazing*.
